[![Build Status](https://github.com/JoeLiu2015/ASN1Viewer/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JoeLiu2015/ASN1Viewer/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This tool parses ASN.1 data or files(*.pfx, .p7b, *.pem, *.cer, *.der, etc) and displays them in a tree view. It is developed in C# and runs exclusively on Windows.

You can use it to visualize and debug ASN.1 encoded data.
